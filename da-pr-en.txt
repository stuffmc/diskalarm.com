FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Kerpen, Germany - March 31st, 2011 - Pomcast.biz is proud to release it's first Mac OS X app after many years of iOS contracting.

Mac OS X tells you when your hard drive is full, but, generally, it's already too late to react.

Would you like to be alerted early enough so you can move or delete files, allowing you to have enough free space for your Mac to run smoothly?

Disk Alarm will let you know in advance, and will spare you a lot of time!


Features:
* Alerts you when you have reach a certain amount of disk space...
* Optionally alerts with a sound, very useful when you are away from the computer screen.
* Runs as an agent app, close the settings window and it will still alert you
* Optionally stays in your menu bar for fast access + mentioning the free space.
* Check manually the space if you don't want to have it automatically.
* Added (optionally) to your login items so it'll always run when the computer starts
* Coming soon in 1.0.1: Ability to see set the "checked space" in percents instead of MB/GB.

Example Minimum Requirements:
* Mac OS X Version 10.6.6 or higher
* Intel Mac
